To perform the pRF mapping, you will first need to create a dedicated Anaconda environment using the .yml environment file "https://github.com/gifale95/RNC/06_in_vivo_validation/03_prf_mapping/01_prf_mapping/prf-workflow.yml".

Then, you need to download the "get_aperture" (https://github.com/gifale95/RNC/06_in_vivo_validation/03_prf_mapping/01_prf_mapping/get_aperture) and "surface_tools" (https://github.com/gifale95/RNC/06_in_vivo_validation/03_prf_mapping/01_prf_mapping/surface_tools) folders, and add them to the same directory as the pRF mapping code.

Finally, edit the i/o directories in the files "prf_mapping_config_s*.json" and "run_prf_mapping_s*.sh", and then run "run_prf_mapping_s*.sh" via terminal.
