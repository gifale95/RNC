- Before running "01_glm_single.py", the V1 and V4 manual delineations in subject-native volume space found in "https://github.com/gifale95/RNC/06_in_vivo_validation/03_prf_mapping/02_delineate_rois/v1_v4_rois_volume/derived/sub-0*/alldata/roi/*h.V*.func.nii.gz". need to be added to the directory "../relational_neural_control/in_vivo_validation/in_vivo_fmri_dataset/derived/sub0*/alldata/roi/".

- Furthermore, you should download the functional data event files from the OpenNeuro dataset: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005503
