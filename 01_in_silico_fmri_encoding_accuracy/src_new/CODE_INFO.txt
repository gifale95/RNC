EDITS OF ORIGINAL CODE

1. The classes in "torch_gnet.py" are modified such that the Encoder returns the pre-filter feature maps too, so that the FWRF models can use these features too to predict brain data.

2. TensorBoard logs are added to the training loop in the "torch_joint_training_unpacked_sequences.learn_params_" function.

3. Change the "load_nsd.ordering_split", "torch_joint_training_unpacked_sequences.learn_params_" and "torch_joint_training_unpacked_sequences.validation_" functions so that the models are trained on the subject-unique images, tested on the 515 shared images with 3 repeats across all subjects, and validated on the remaining shared images.

4. Change the "iterate_subject_ordering_minibatches", "subject_training_pass", "subject_holdout_pass" and "learn_params_" functions in the "torch_joint_training_unpacked_sequences" modules, so that the code no longer assumes that models are trained on multiple subjects.
