With "manual_roi_delineations.sh" and "manual_roi_delineations_flattened.sh" you can use freeview to delineate areas on inflated and flattened brain surfaces, respectively.

The "surface_2_vol.sh" code transforms the ROI delineations from surface space to volume space.

"v1_v4_rois_volume" contains the V1 and V4 ROIs in subject-native volume space.
