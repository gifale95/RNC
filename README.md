## 📖 Theoretical motivation

Seeing is underpinned by a complex interconnected network of multiple brain regions of interest (ROIs) jointly representing visual information. However, the representational content of each ROI is typically studied in isolation, and using limited sets of experimenter-picked stimuli. Here, we addressed this by developing [Relational Neural Control (RNC)][rnc_website]. RNC generates and explores in silico functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses for large amounts of images, finding controlling images that align or disentangle responses across areas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content.

We developed two RNC variants:

* **Univariate RNC** controls _univariate_ fMRI responses (i.e., responses averaged over all voxels within an ROI), thus exploring representational relationships for visual information encoded in the strongest activation trends common across all ROI voxels.
* **Multivariate RNC** controls _multivariate_ fMRI responses (i.e., population response of all voxels within a ROI), thus exploring representational relationships for visual information encoded in the multi-voxel response patterns.

To thoroughly explore the visual space in search for controlling stimuli, we applied RNC to in silico neural responses for thousands of naturalistic images, that is, neural responses generated through encoding models from the [Neural Encoding Dataset (NED)][ned_website]. Specifically, this includes NED-generated in silico fMRI responses for the 73,000 [Natural Scenes Dataset][nsd] ([Allen et al., 2022][allen]) images, the 50,000 [ImageNet 2012 Challenge][imagenet] ([Russakovsky et al., 2015][russakovsky]) images, or the 26,107 [THINGS Database][things] ([Hebart et al., 2019][hebart]) images.

## 💻 Tutorials

We created interactive tutorials where you can learn how to use univariate and and multivariate RNC. These tutorials are available on either _Google Colab_ ([univariate RNC][uni_rnc_colab], [multivariate RNC][multi_rnc_colab]) or _Jupyter Notebook_ ([univariate RNC][uni_rnc_jupyter], [multivariate RNC][multi_rnc_jupyter]).
